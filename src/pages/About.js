        Chealsea started making cocktails in 1997. She has grown her passion for
        cocktails into a successful cocktail club called Chealsea's cocktails.
        These clubs occur around the country with branches in London, manchester
        and Birmingham. You can be sure to enjoy a tasty glass of cocktail when
        you join the club.You can search some of the cocktails which are made at
        chealsea's and see the recipe and try to replicate or infuse your own
        flavour to these wonderfully crafted drinks. Enjoy drinking !
